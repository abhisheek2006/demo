Doctors diagnosed it as chronic pharyngitis and told me it could only be managed with medication. I dealt with it throughout my life, experiencing frequent coughs and colds. I visited many states across India, but the advice remained the same: avoid spicy food and cold drinks, wear a mask, and take other precautions. However, when I visited Swasti Homoeo Clinic, Dr. Smriti ma\'am listened carefully to my health checkup report from Mumbai. She suggested switching to homeopathy, and after six months of treatment, my chronic pharyngitis is gone. I am very grateful to Dr. Smriti ma\'am.',

She is highly skilled homeopathic doctor who has done an excellent job in my case where many of the doctors and allopathic medicines couldn\'t help me. The greatest thing in her is her friendly nature and her service moto of charging very less.Two years ago I was diagnosed with endometriotic cyst of 7cm in right ovary and was asked to get the oophorectomy done asap. Consulted many doctors and spend lot of money but no use. I have faced horrible things like excess fatigue, prolonged and heavy periods, excessive pain in the right leg, eczema, loss of appetite,sleeplessness. Have completely lost hope on life and thought never be able to become normal again but fortunately I met Dr smriti 6 months back and can\'t believe the magic she has done to me that too by charging very very less amount for treatment. Frankly saying I am back to my beautiful life again. Cyst got reduced to much more extent, periods got regularised, my appetite is back, got rid of eczema, able to sleep peacefully, doing household things with an ease.She has not only treated me but my husband and father too. Thanks to such an amazing doctor 🙏',

As you can see how badly my scalp was affected before treatment. I was worried that no matter what i do this recurring issue which i was facing for long time would come back and i have to shave my head every now and then to clean the buildup. Which was definitely not the solution. I tried Allopathy for a year only to have pathetic results & the expensive allopathic medicines,lotions had no effect. The scalp was back to same after a week. But after research i came to know skin issues are internal and needs targeted approach for treatment. Hence switched to Homeopathy. I am very thankful to Dr. Smriti for the care & treatment provided. Due to which i am happy with the results and its been almost 6 months as of now.',
